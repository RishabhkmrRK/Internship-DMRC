# DELHI METRO RAIL CORPORATION INTERNSHIP
## Overview
From June 04,2019 to July 30,2019, I had the privilege of doing internship at Delhi Metro Rail Coorporation (DMRC), New Delhi. The goal of this internship was to learn different technical and management aspects of how Delhi metro works and maintains the whole network which now became the backbone of Delhi transport system. Over the course of internship, there were three departments of Delhi metro in which I had given opportunity to explore and work, that were OHE (Over-Head Equipment), PSI (Power Station Installation) and Scada (senosors/ train monitoring station). Here are documents and skills that I acquired from this internship:

## Skills acquired from DMRC internship:

1. **Management:** <br/> One of the main key of running Delhi metro on time is management. Delhi metro has an average daily ridership of around 50 Lakhs (5 million), so considering all aspects like train maintenance,  power interruption, track maintenance, it is a big task. I got to learn how these things take place, these all maintenance work has to take place at night in short span of 5-6 hour window. More than 300 KM track is checked every night and any fault in train coaches also has to be taken care of.
 
 2. **Communication:** <br/> DMRC has a very excellent work and everyone there is positive and encouraging, this made communication with anyone very easy. Plus our supervisor encouraged us to ask questions regarding Delhi metro.
 
 3. **Practical Implementation:** <br/> During this internship, I got to know how any part or structure has to go through many stages of inspection and testing before it gets implemented. For ex, I got work with Test engineer team, their task was to test a vacuum SF6 circuit breaker which had to be installed on the red-line Delhi metro. Any equipment failure during online hours can cause delay in trains which can interrupt the whole metro line.
 
 4. **Team Work:** <br/> In second part of internship, I was stationed at PSI-RSS (Power Supply Installation - Receiving Sub-Station, this is where metro line gets its power 25kv, Receiving Voltage is 66kv which is step down using transformers) at Kashmiri Gate which is one of the three power stations on red-line. The station had to be in constant communication with main control unit which monitors every train on track during working hours.  Any problem has to be taken care of immediately, although DMRC has a very redundant and robust network but it puts the load on other power stations.

5. **Technical skill (Making a redundant network):** <br/> One thing, I found interesting which I can also implement in my project too is to make it redundant. In Delhi Metro, both power lines (which carry power to Metro trains) and Signal Lines (which carry data from every metro like each train location or data from sensors to monitoring station) have a redundant line/ secondary line which is there in case, the primary line fails, the network then can be shifted to secondary line and won't cause any disturbance to schedule of metro trains. Later fault in primary line can be resolved during non working hours and again network can be shifted back to primary lines.

## Conclusion

This internship has been an excellent and rewarding experience. I can conclude that there have been a lot Iâ€™ve learnt from my internship at Delhi Metro Rail Corportaion. Needless to say, there is lot that I was not able to know and explore but with given time period of 2 months, it was great to learn between the engineers with vast knowledge of their respective fields in an Industrial Environment.

## Future Work
One problem that I witness was that the maintenance work of checking train tracks was done manually which was a time taking process. This problem can be solved using machine learning, in which one can input the live feed of train tracks through camera and the pre-trained model will be able detect any fault there in the tracks. With this model, the time taken to check and maintain train tracks can be drastically decreased.

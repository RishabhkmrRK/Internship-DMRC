# Internship-DMRC

dmrc internship

What I learned from dmrc internship:

 1. Management: One of the main key of running delhi metro on time is management. Delhi metro has an average daily rideship of around 50 lakhs (5 million), so considering all aspects like train maintaince, power entruption, track maintanence is a big task. I got to learn how these things take place, these all maintanence work has take place at night in short span of 5-6 hour window. More than 300 KM of is checked every night and any fault in train coaches also has to be taken care of.
 
 2. Communication: DMRC has a very excellent work and everyone there is positive and encourging, this made communication with anyone very easy. Plus our supervisor encourged us to ask questions regarding Delhi metro.
 
 3. Practical Implemention: Diring this internship, I got to know how any part or structure has to go through many stages of inspection and testing before it get implemented. For ex. I got work with Test engineer team, their task was to test a vacuum circuit breaker which had to installed on the red-line delhi metro. Any equipment failure during online hours can cause delay in trains which can interrupt the whole metro line.
 
 4. Team Work: In second part of internship, I was stationed at Electrical power grid at kashmiri gate which is one of the three unit on red-line. The station had be in constant communication with main control unit which monitors every train on line.  Any problem has to be taken care of immediately, although DMRC has a very redundend and robust network but it puts the load on other power units.
